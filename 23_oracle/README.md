Oracles were born of a desire to expand the types of collaboration possible on blockchains. They connect blockchains to external systems and enable access to data from off-chain systems, acting as a source of truth to the blockchain. As a result, they provide blockchains with secure gateways to off-chain systems, allowing smart contract applications to verify external events, and trigger actions on external services.

There are different types of oracles that involve some combination of fetching, validating, and delivering data:
- Input oracles: these fetch data from off-chain sources and deliver it to the blockchain network for smart contract consumption
- Output oracles: enable smart contracts to trigger actions on off-chain systems
- Cross-chain oracles: Enable interoperability between blockchains, allowing the reading and writing of information between different blockchains
- Compute-enabled oracles: these are becoming popular as they provide a very useful, secure, off-chain, computation solution to perform computations on a set of inputs; it is an alternative to the comparatively expensive computation cost on the Ethereum network
